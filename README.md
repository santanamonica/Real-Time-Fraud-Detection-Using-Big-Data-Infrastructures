# Using-Big-Data-Infrastructures
Multiple assignments using big data infrastructures such as NiFi, Kafka, Spark, HBase, Solr, 
Hive, and HDFS. Learned how to create custom transformations, use SQL demands, Scala demands, PySpark demands, MapReduce, HBase data manipulation, create HBase tables, and create queries by filters. I also learned how to create producer and consumer tests.
